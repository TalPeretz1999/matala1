            Dragon fruit grows on the Hylocereus cactus, also known as the
            Honolulu queen, whose flowers only open at night. The plant is
            native to southern Mexico and Central America. Today, it is grown
            all over the world. It goes by many names, including pitaya,
            pitahaya, and strawberry pear. The two most common types have bright
            red skin with green scales that resemble a dragon — hence the name.
            The most widely available variety has white pulp with black seeds,
            though a less common type with red pulp and black seeds exists as
            well. Another variety — referred to as yellow dragon fruit — has
            yellow skin and white pulp with black seeds. Dragon fruit may look
            exotic, but its flavors are similar to other fruits. Its taste has
            been described as a slightly sweet cross between a kiwi and a pear.

            Dragon fruit contains small amounts of several nutrients. It’s also
            a decent source of iron, magnesium, and fiber. Here are the
            nutrition facts for a serving of 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams (1Trusted
            Source): Calories: 60 Protein: 1.2 grams Fat: 0 grams Carbs: 13
            grams Fiber: 3 grams Vitamin C: 3% of the RDI Iron: 4% of the RDI
            Magnesium: 10% of the RDI Given the high amount of fiber and
            magnesium, as well as the extremely low calorie content, dragon
            fruit can be considered a highly nutrient-dense fruit.

          Overall, dragon fruit appears to be safe. However, people may develop
          an allergic reaction in some rare cases. In two cases, women with no
          history of food allergies developed anaphylactic reactions after
          consuming a fruit mixture that contained dragon fruit. Testing
          confirmed that they had antibodies against dragon fruit in their blood
          (18Trusted Source, 19). These are the only two reported allergic
          reactions at this point, but other people may be allergic to this
          fruit without knowing it.

          Though it may look intimidating, dragon fruit is very easy to eat.
          Here’s how to eat dragon fruit: Select a ripe fruit with bright red,
          evenly colored skin that gives slightly when squeezed. Use a sharp
          knife and cut straight through the fruit, slicing it in half. You can
          use a spoon to eat the fruit out of the skin or peel the skin off and
          slice the pulp into small pieces. Ideas for serving dragon fruit:
          Simply slice it up and eat it as is. Chop it into small pieces and top
          with Greek yogurt and chopped nuts. Include it in a salad.
